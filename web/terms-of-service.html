                <li>Send and receive messages over mesh networks</li>
                <li>View and manage mesh network nodes</li>
                <li>Configure connected Meshtastic radio devices</li>

                The App is designed to work offline. Certain optional features
                (such as cloud sync, image sharing, and social profiles) require
                an internet connection and may depend on third-party services
                described in these Terms.
            </p>
