## Full Description (App Store)

### Mesh-First Communication

Socialmesh connects you to Meshtastic radios for off-grid communication. Messages hop between devices, reaching people nearby without cell towers or internet.

### Signals: Presence, Not Performance

Leave short, ephemeral traces for people nearby. Signals expire automatically and never get ranked or promoted. No followers. No likes. Just nearby awareness.

- Signals are temporary (15 min to 24 hours)
- Signals stay local — no global feed
- Images unlock based on proximity or authentication
- Works without an account

### No Internet? No Problem.
Connect via Bluetooth to affordable Meshtastic radios (~$30). Your messages travel through the mesh, bouncing between devices until they reach their destination. Works in remote wilderness, underground, or during network outages.
