# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore

node_modules
#!include:.gitignore

# Include built JS files required for deploy. .gitignore excludes `lib/`,
# but Cloud Build needs the compiled files. The following explicitly
# re-includes the `lib/` directory so it is uploaded during `gcloud` deploy.
!lib/**
