# Socialmesh

A Meshtastic companion app for iOS and Android. Connect to your mesh radio, exchange messages, track nearby nodes, and configure your device — all without internet.

**Signals** — Leave short, ephemeral traces for people nearby. Signals expire automatically and never leave the mesh. No followers. No likes. Just presence.

## Features

### Messaging

- **Channel Messaging** — Send and receive on multiple channels
- **Direct Messages** — Private node-to-node communication
- **Quick Responses** — Pre-configured canned messages for fast replies
- **Message Search** — Find messages across all conversations
- **Offline Queue** — Messages queued when disconnected, sent when reconnected

### Network & Nodes

- **Node Discovery** — See all nodes on your mesh with signal strength, battery, and location
- **Network Topology** — Visual graph showing how nodes connect to each other
- **Traceroute** — Trace the path packets take to reach any node
- **Signal History** — Charts showing SNR and RSSI over time
- **Favorites** — Pin important nodes for quick access

### Maps & Location

- **Node Map** — Interactive map showing all nodes with GPS
- **Waypoints** — Drop, share, and navigate to waypoints
- **Location Sharing** — Broadcast your position to the mesh
- **Multiple Map Styles** — Street, satellite, and terrain views

### Device Configuration

- **LoRa Settings** — Region, modem preset, hop limit, frequency slot
- **Power Management** — Sleep mode, shutdown timeout, power saving
- **Position Settings** — GPS mode, broadcast interval, smart position
- **Bluetooth** — Pairing mode, PIN code, power settings
- **Network** — WiFi, Ethernet, MQTT bridge configuration
- **Display** — Screen timeout, brightness, flip screen, OLED burn-in
- **Detection Sensor** — Motion and door sensor configuration
- **Canned Messages** — Configure quick response messages on device

### Audio

- **Ringtone Library** — Browse 7,000+ RTTTL ringtones organized by category
- **Preview & Set** — Listen before sending to your device
- **Custom Ringtones** — Create and save your own RTTTL compositions

### Integrations

- **IFTTT Webhooks** — Trigger automations on node events and geofence alerts
- **MQTT** — Configure MQTT bridge for internet uplink
- **QR Codes** — Import/export channels and share node info via QR

### Safety

- **Emergency SOS** — One-tap emergency broadcast with optional GPS
- **Geofence Alerts** — Get notified when nodes leave a defined area
- **Battery Alerts** — Low battery notifications for tracked nodes

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter** — Cross-platform UI framework
- **Riverpod** — Reactive state management
- **Protocol Buffers** — Meshtastic protocol implementation
- **SQLite** — Local data persistence
- **Firebase** — Analytics and crash reporting

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.10+
- Xcode (for iOS)
- Android Studio (for Android)
- Protocol Buffers compiler (`brew install protobuf`)

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate protobuf code
./scripts/generate_protos.sh

# Run on device
flutter run
```

## Building from Source

### What works out of the box

- BLE connection to Meshtastic devices
- All mesh communication features (messaging, node discovery, channels)
- Local SQLite storage
- Protobuf encoding/decoding

### External services (optional)

The app uses Firebase for optional cloud features. Without Firebase configuration:

- **Analytics/Crashlytics** — Disabled silently
- **Cloud sync** — Falls back to local-only mode
- **Authentication** — Sign-in options unavailable

To enable Firebase features, add your own `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS).

### Build commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate Meshtastic protobufs
./scripts/generate_protos.sh

# iOS
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
flutter build ios

# Android
flutter build apk                    # Debug APK
flutter build apk --release          # Release APK
flutter build appbundle --release    # Play Store bundle
```

Missing backend configuration disables cloud features but does not block the build.

## URL Scheme

Socialmesh registers the `socialmesh://` URL scheme:

- `socialmesh://channel/<base64>` — Import channel configuration
- `socialmesh://node/<base64>` — Import node information
