# Privacy Policy

**Socialmesh**  
**Last Updated: January 14, 2026**

## Overview

Socialmesh ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("App").

## Our Privacy Commitment

Socialmesh is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your communications should belong to you, not to corporations or third parties.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- **No Account Required**: We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information to use the App.
- **No Message Storage**: Your messages are transmitted directly between devices via the Meshtastic mesh network. We do not have access to, store, or process your messages on any server.
- **No Location Tracking**: While the App may use GPS for mesh network functionality, your location data stays on your device and is only shared with other mesh network participants if you choose to enable location sharing.
- **No Analytics or Tracking**: We do not use analytics services to track your behavior within the App.
- **No Advertising**: We do not display advertisements or share data with advertising networks.

## Data That Stays on Your Device

The following data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to us:

- App settings and preferences
- Message history
- Node information and contacts
- Saved routes and waypoints
- Ringtone and theme preferences

## Signals Feature

Signals are ephemeral messages broadcast over the Meshtastic mesh network. They:
- Are stored locally on your device until they expire
- Are never uploaded to any server unless you sign in and attach an image
- Expire automatically based on the TTL you select (15 minutes to 24 hours)
- Never contain analytics or tracking data

When signed in, image uploads are stored temporarily in secure cloud storage for mesh sharing. Images inherit the Signal's TTL and are deleted when the Signal expires.

## Third-Party Services

- Anonymous transaction identifiers

### Firebase Crashlytics (Crash Reporting)
We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports to improve app stability. This may include:
- Device type and operating system version
- App version
- Crash logs and stack traces

No personal information or message content is included in crash reports.

Firebase's privacy policy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy

### Meshtastic Network
Communications over the Meshtastic mesh network are peer-to-peer. We have no involvement in or access to mesh network communications. Please refer to the Meshtastic project for information about mesh network privacy: https://meshtastic.org

## Data Security

Since we don't collect your data, there's no data to secure on our servers. Your local data is protected by your device's built-in security features.

## Children's Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since we don't collect personal information from any users, this applies universally.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App and updating the "Last Updated" date.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, there is no personal data to access, correct, or delete. You can clear all local app data at any time through the App's settings.
